# ml-trading

This is a tool to assist with technical analysis for short term traders. 
The model is built using pytorch and scikit learn, and trained on historical 
data from alphavantage.com. 

The intended use is to supplement an existing trading strategy, rather than using ML to manage the entire portfolio.
